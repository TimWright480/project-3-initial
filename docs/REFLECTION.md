AI helps alot for this one. There are alot of lines of code on this project then the other ones.

The main thing for that in order for the test to run successfully.

The GentlyDownTheStreamTest test class has to be left alone as is. Making adjusting even using chatGPT will get you code in weird places leading to errors and exception
handling fails. This code passes all the test now. Since this is only about test, having a main method class is not used for this. With the code generated
for the TODO list, it wasn't perfect. With that code, the test failed the first time.

With using AI, the result was giving a couple of option is new to me. The first option to change the catch blocks to rethrow exceptions directly in the
sortedfruits method. It starts to narrow down the code to only the need block and not the entire code in a class. Then the test worked.

Then the test passed on my second try but fixing errors is more time-consuming because of the different options
to fix the code.

AI is still great at fixing codes to get it to run in a very fast matter and to learn how it works but also asking questions.
